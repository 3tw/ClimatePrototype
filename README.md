# Climate Prototype

Prototype webpage made for people.ooo workshop. The challenge was to form an idea that would successfully communicate the climate crisis. This project shows that the disruptive nature of climate change needs not to be conveyed only through words. Instead, the user is interrupted and for a brief moment reminded that he cannot hide from the disastrous reality.
