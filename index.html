            Human activities are continuing to affect the Earth’s energy budget by changing the emissions and resulting atmospheric concentrations of radiatively important gases and aerosols and by changing land
            surface properties. Previous assessments have already shown through multiple lines of evidence that the
            climate is changing across our planet, largely as a result of human activities. The most compelling
            evidence of climate change derives from observations of the atmosphere, land, oceans and cryosphere.
            Unequivocal evidence from in situ observations and ice core records shows that the atmospheric
            concentrations of important greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous
            oxide (N2O) have increased over the last few centuries. The processes affecting climate can exhibit considerable natural variability. Even in the absence of
            external forcing, periodic and chaotic variations on a vast range of spatial and temporal scales are
            observed. Much of this variability can be represented by simple (e.g., unimodal or power law)
            distributions, but many components of the climate system also exhibit multiple states—for instance, the
            glacial interglacial cycles and certain modes of internal variability such as El Niño-Southern
            Oscillation (ENSO). Movement between states can occur as a result of natural variability, or in response
            to external forcing. The relationship among variability, forcing and response reveals the complexity of
            the dynamics of the climate system: the relationship between forcing and response for some parts of the
            system seems reasonably linear; in other cases this relationship is much more complex. Multiple Lines of Evidence for Climate Change Global mean surface air temperatures over land and oceans have increased over the last 100 years.
            Temperature measurements in the oceans show a continuing increase in the heat content of the oceans.
            Analyses based on measurements of the Earth’s radiative budget suggest a small positive energy imbalance
            that serves to increase the global heat content of the Earth system. Observations from satellites and in
            situ measurements show a trend of significant reductions in the mass balance of most land ice masses and
            in Arctic sea ice. The oceans’ uptake of CO2 is having a significant effect on the chemistry of sea
            water. Paleoclimatic reconstructions have helped place ongoing climate change in the perspective of
            natural climate variability. Observations of CO2 concentrations, globally averaged temperature and sea level rise are generally
            well within the range of the extent of the earlier IPCC projections.
