# Climate Prototype

Prototype webpage made for people.ooo workshop. The challenge was to come up with an idea that would successfully communicate the risks of climate crisis.

I approached the task by transgressing the "user-first" paradigm. This project shows that the disruptive nature of climate change shouldn't be merely given as a consumable content. Instead, the message is mediated as a disorder. The user is interrupted and for a brief moment reminded that he cannot hide from the disastrous reality. Climate change suddenly affects not only the planet but his online experience.
